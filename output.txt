She is tired of "fighting" her end stage  liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of  life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice,  which we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would  like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the  patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably  be DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP).  Therefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also  discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter  placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged  to home with hospice on ___.  # Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient  presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed  with tramadol and morphine. She underwent ___ paracentesis  on ___ with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies  on the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant  improvement in her pain.   # Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that  she had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes.  After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x  2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been  persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be  monitored.  # Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status was A+Ox3  on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose  in-house and at discharge.  CHRONIC ISSUES ==============  # Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic  hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia  related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis  dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic  through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on  10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she  will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting.  # HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were  continued in-house and at discharge.    # COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued  in-house and at discharge.  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture [ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new) [ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have  biweekly BMPs (script written). If K > 5.3, she should be given  kayexelate once weekly. Lab results will be faxed/sent to Dr.  ___. [ ] Continue conversation regarding pleurex catheter placement  and code status. [ ] She will continue to have twice weekly paracenteses  # Code: full   # Emergency Contact: ___ ___    ___ on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.    Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___,  It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___. You  were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely  that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from  your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid  was removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to  have a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came  down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as  an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a  representative from hospice. Because of your repeated  paracenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex  catheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice  coordinators, and you will be discharged home with hospice.  We wish you all the best!  Your ___ care team   Followup Instructions: ___
